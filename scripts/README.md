pm2 logs secure-audio-api
pm2 monit

# System resources
htop
df -h
free -h

# Web server
sudo systemctl status nginx
sudo tail -f /var/log/nginx/access.log

# Security
sudo fail2ban-client status
sudo fail2ban-client status nginx-limit-req

# SSL certificates
sudo certbot certificates
```

## üîÑ Updates

To update your application:

```bash
cd /var/www/secure-audio
./scripts/deploy-app.sh
